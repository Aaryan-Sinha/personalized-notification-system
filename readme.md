# Personalized Notification System 🚀

## 📚 Overview

This project is a fully containerized microservices-based backend built with:
- Node.js (Express)
- MongoDB
- RabbitMQ (Queue)
- GraphQL Gateway (Apollo Server)

It allows users to receive personalized notifications based on browsing history, purchase activities, and order updates.

## 📦 Microservices Overview

| Microservice | Responsibilities |
|:---|:---|
| User Service | User Registration, Login, Preferences |
| Notification Service | Manage Notifications |
| Recommendation Service | Generate Personalized Recommendations |
| Order Mock Service | Simulate Order Placements and Updates |

## 🐳 Docker & Containers

- All services are Dockerized with separate Dockerfiles.
- MongoDB and RabbitMQ also run in containers.
- **Single command** to start entire ecosystem:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
🔥 How to Run the Project
1. Install Prerequisites
Docker Desktop

Node.js (Optional for local runs)

2. Start the Full System
bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --build
MongoDB: localhost:27017

RabbitMQ Management UI: http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest)

GraphQL Gateway: http://localhost:4000/graphql

🎯 Testing with GraphQL
Use GraphQL Playground at http://localhost:4000/graphql.

Sample Queries:

Register User

Update Preferences

Fetch Unread Notifications

Create Order

👉 Check GraphQL Playground Queries for ready-to-use operations.

📂 Postman Collection
(Attached postman-collection.json) — ready for testing APIs if you want to hit REST APIs directly!

🧠 System Internals
Services communicate asynchronously via RabbitMQ.

Notifications are queued and processed independently.

Scheduled jobs (node-cron) push recommendations and order updates periodically.

MongoDB used for service-specific data isolation.
